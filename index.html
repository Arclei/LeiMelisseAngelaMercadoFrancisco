                <h2>Lei Melisse Angela M. Francisco</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Lei Melisse Angela M. Francisco. I am 19 years old and I live in Tumalim, Nasugbu, Batangas, where I have stayed since I was a child. I want to share a little bit about myself so you can get to know me better. I grew up in a simple family that always reminds me to study hard, be kind, and never give up. Those lessons help me a lot, not only in school but also in life. We are three siblings in the family, and I am the middle child. I studied in Batangas from elementary up to high school, and then I went to Tagaytay for senior high school where I took the STEM strand. Actually, this is not my dream course. My first choice was Civil Engineering, but unfortunately, the slots were already full. Since PUP is my dream university, I still decided to enroll in my second choice, which is Education. And I am happy because I am here now, studying in the school I dreamed of. Since I was young, I have always loved Mathematics. I enjoy solving math equations and math problems. Even if they are challenging, I still find them fun to work on. It feels so satisfying every time I am able to solve something related to math. Apart from my academic interests, I also want to learn practical things like cooking. I want to learn how to cook and hopefully add it to my hobbies. I don’t know how to cook yet, but I am willing to learn. I want to try new things, step out of my comfort zone, and enjoy life.

When it comes to the things I enjoy doing, especially during my free time, I usually just spend time on my cellphone. I love listening to music because music is really my life. I always listen to it no matter what I am doing—whether cleaning the house, working on activities, or even walking. Listening to my favorite songs makes me feel calm. Aside from that, I also enjoy watching movies and reading Wattpad stories whenever I don’t have anything to do. But most of the time, it ends up with me taking a short nap, because im such a sleepy head. Those little things help me relax and recharge after a long day.

I think I’m good at being patient and working with other people. I like helping classmates when they need support, especially in subjects I’m confident in. I also try my best to stay positive even when things get hard, because I believe that every challenge has something to teach us.

That is how I would describe myself. I hope that through this short essay, you were able to know me better. I know I cannot put everything about myself here, but at least I was able to share some of the highlights of who I am.</p>
